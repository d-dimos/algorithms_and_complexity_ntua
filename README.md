# Algorithms & Complexity (2020-2021)

This repository hosts the **problem statements** and **solutions** to the **theoretical** and **programming** problem sets of the **Algorithms & Complexity** lecture series held by NTUA during the 7th semester (Winter 2020-2021) of the ECE undergraduate course. The problems involve algorithms implemented in **C++** related to the following concepts:

- Divide and Conquer
- Union-Find
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Related Algorithms and Variations
